This repository contains the content of [leetagg.substack.com](https://leetagg.substack.com). It makes sense to use source control when writing words, even if they aren't source code. Once you get used to having a git log at your disposal it's really, really hard to do anything without one. From switching devices, and dealing with obsolete hardware to simply being able to compare your own content editions; it's a really helpful personal productivity and organisation tool that I would recommend for anyone with ADHD or just those who are easily distracted. Git for the win.   

## About Me

The main thing I’m interested in is a sustainable and aspirational version of humanity and I can’t really understand why we don’t have that yet it seems so simple.

I used to be an average but incredibly passionate software developer, hence my knowledge of version control systems. I think people who worked with me in the past genuinely enjoyed having me on their team and I always gave my heart and soul to my work. Anyone who worked with me also knows suffering because of my (at the time) undiagnosed neurodivergence which lead to needless battles over things like accidental smear campaigns (sorry), semi-colons and brackets amongst bursts of dysregulation and a general sense of people not knowing if I was joking or serious or if I was clever or a complete idiot. 

I have an Autism Spectrum Disorder (or Differences?) and ADHD. This has impacted the relationships I have, and my ability to form and maintain relationships. Basically I have no friends, identity, in-group or predefined cultural allegiance. I wouldn't even know where to begin maintaining real friendships. For most of my life I was pretty bitter about it, masked, drank, pretended to fit-in, and did a pretty poor job of hiding my inadequacies. Now I’ve come to terms with it and I really don’t want to make friends with you anymore, or participate in any social norms such as drinking or pretending to fit in but I do love humanity, and I do love our planet and I do want biological and intelligent life on this planet to succeed.

If you care about the world and feel comfortable around people who write the kinds of words I write then feel free to hang out, I won't bite (unless you hurt innocent people). I appreciate advice, kind thoughts, humane thinking, unconditional kindness and heartfelt compassion. Just keep the drama to a minimum, I've been pretty burnt out since my diagnosis and I already have the world to worry about without adding trivial BS to the stack.
