This repository contains the content of [leetagg.substack.com](https://leetagg.substack.com). It makes sense to use source control when writing words, even if they aren't source code. Once you get used to having a git log at your disposal it's really, really hard to do anything without one. From switching devices, and dealing with obsolete hardware to simply being able to compare your own content editions; it's a really helpful personal productivity and organisation tool that I would recommend for anyone with ADHD or just those who are easily distracted. Git is a widely applicable invention. 

## About Me

The main thing I’m interested in is a sustainable and aspirational version of humanity and I can’t really understand why we don’t have that yet. It seems so simple, but we are utterly disturbed and repulsed by it, aren't we? Or are we?

I used to be an average but incredibly passionate software developer, hence my knowledge of version control systems, but actually passion is transferable and programming never truly deserved the passion I gave it. I think people who worked with me in the past genuinely enjoyed having me on their team and I always gave my heart and soul to my work. Anyone who worked with me also knows suffering because of my (at the time) undiagnosed neurodivergence which lead to needless battles over things like accidental smear campaigns (sorry L.B.), semicolons and brackets amongst bursts of dysregulation and a general sense of people not knowing if I was joking or serious or if I was clever or a complete idiot. 

I might not be worth anything in your eyes, and I'm really sorry about that, I hope you'll be okay. I see myself as a strong person who is willing to stand up for honesty, integrity and kindness and to treat the world with compassion because I believe in humanity, our cultural and social evolution and that we have the power to create the most aspirational world and not just conform to a world of hatred, prejudice and abuse. Can you do it too?
