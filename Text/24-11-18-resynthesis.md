## Word Sensitivity

Sensitivity is key but at some point you have to call a spade a spade. The problem with spades, and what we call them, is that spades trigger people. In that dysregulated limbic state, we can't synthesize information or classify its truthfulness because our capacity is consumed in fight or flight mode and all we have left is our rigid, conditioned notions of spades, and quite frankly, we don't have time to talk about them.

The truth is always kind, even if it hurts. If your intention is to hurt someone, this isn't the same thing. If you have no compassion for them or don't wish to hold space for their pain, then speaking a painful truth is intended to cause them harm or discomfort. If so, you aren't being honest about yourself, and it's truly your inability to hold space for the suffering of others that is the problem. If your goal is seeking togetherness, then truth is kind, even when it hurts, because pain leads to compassion and compassion leads to togetherness. For that reason, itâ€™s a healthy boundary to put kindness first and sensitivity second and to always speak the truth and hold compassionate space and help support people with their negative feelings towards the truth because you know it leads to togetherness and a better future for everyone.

Call the spade what it is. Create the space for togetherness by being compassionate towards the triggered. Their being incensed does not change the truth, but it gives something meaningful to reflect on and work through. Give people time and space to grow. Be sensitive, but never rob people of the opportunity to know the truth if you truly care about them. I believe this is the birthplace of antifragility and respect for all people and living things. 

## Genocide

This spade is called Genocide.

The Israeli genocide of the Palestinian people is one of the most complicated and contentious issues in the world today according to those who wish to overcomplicate it. Rooted in geopolitics, mostly I assume, because Israel has pre-implicated western political leaders and media organisations in the narrative of the 'conflict'. As a result, the western political class are complicit and contorted by their pre-purchase, unable to escape the corners they've painted themselves in to. The idea pushed by these people, that any and all negative opinion about Israel or Israeli citizen's behaviour automatically constitutes antisemitism is in my opinion racist propaganda. It highlights and denotes their implication in the genocide and I believe the term antisemitism is weaponized to a degree that it is now useless in describing actual religious bigotry. It's plausible that these groups act out of self-preservation and deflecting shame for being bought rather than an actual belief that what they are saying is truthful or warranted. Either way, there is no accountability for the sell-out or bias and vulnerable people are dying as a result of their carelessness and complicity.

It's not even really that complicated either. History is repeating itself with respect to every other displaced indigenous population under settler colonisation and the brutality of an oppressive, invader that has zero desire to understand or hold space for the displaced people. In every case, the complexity of any settler-colonial situation arises from the fact that the colonisers claims to land, resources and governance (monopoly on violence and power) directly contradicts the historical owners rights. If the colonising people cannot integrate the perspective of themselves as an addition to the rightful indigenous owners rather than a replacement for them, it stands to reason that they will desire the destruction of the displaced. This is nothing more than narrow-minded rigidity for an invasive agenda, appropriating the property of indigenous people and wiping out thousands of years of collective wisdom and culture in the process with no regard whatsoever. When one party is unwilling to compromise or acknowledge the perspectives and rights of the other party, it leads to a situation where a resolution is impossible and that is regardless of the cooperation and kindness of the displaced indigenous population. The original inhabitants grace and kindness is meaningless in the face of an agenda that seeks their complete annihilation.

## The Holy Land 

I'm sure there are many Israelis who genuinely believe they have historical and religious claims to Palestinian land. And that's okay, people can believe they have a claim to something without actually having a claim to it, especially if that's what they've been taught to believe. The truth is, we all have as much right as the dinosaurs did to owning any piece of Earth, regardless of where that is on the globe or at any point in time. 

The aim of humanity is ecological balance and sustainability not dominance. Our success, as intelligent life, is determined by our ability to find harmony, to temper mindless extraction that would lead to imbalance, and to overcome our desire to dominate other life through the fulfilment of homeostasis for the whole. The idea of a holy land should only ever be seen as one that is diverse and equally inclusive of all people and living things. Self idealised superiority or any claim of right over another person stems from out of control narrative, not from God. In my perspective, this is the symptom of a civilization-level cancer that has no self-awareness or ability to achieve apoptosis or homeostasis. It becomes all consuming and destroys innocence, beauty and life, including itself, as it propagates.

We exist in an objective, material world and this is the foundation of all truth. Narratives that lead to discrimination and inequality will eventually be lost to objectivity over time. The energy it takes to maintain false narratives can only be sustained temporarily. Even if that temporality is in the centuries, it too will be unsustainable over larger timeframes. The holy land is earth, for all living things from cyanobacteria to whatever we evolve into over many millennia. Let's be objective about that.

It also ignores the geology, the shifting of tectonic plates, the struggles of the dinosaurs and in fact the struggle of all life for the last four billion years. the notion of "God" existed that whole time in the energy of what biological life is. the manifestation of intelligence gives rise to emergent thinking that requires "god" as a tool or mental technology for overcoming problems of incoherence and incompatibility. The whole point behind "god" is to bring people together. The universe has more to offer us than our own self destructive claims to superiority over other life on this planet, it's just an invalid perspective with respect to our emergent purpose as intelligent life.

Subjective narratives are often used as a tool or device to justify the entitlement of one group over another, it's a pattern that we see again and again, from the colonization of indigenous lands to the oppression of marginalized groups within society. Belief systems that are based on kindness, truth and justice will ultimately prevail over those that are built on falsehoods, oppression and a need to displace others or treat innocent people as sub-human or unworthy. When a group of people claim their subjective narrative is more important to achieve than an objective need like "unconditional kindness for all living things", or ecological sustainability, the energy required to propagate the subjective narrative is so onerous that eventually it will be abandoned, especially after genocide, the subjective narrative that manufactured the conditions of genocide, being so culturally important at the time, will be stowed away, no longer relevant, shamefully hidden and buried forever. It's a sobering and humbling reminder that we must always strive to base our beliefs and actions on objective truth and justice, rather than subjective agendas and entitlements.

## One True God

Sensitivity is key but at some point we really, truly have to call a spade a spade. We must become grounded in a deep respect for the interconnectedness of all life on Earth, and for the vast and complex history of our planet. The struggles and triumphs of all the species that have come before us are a reminder that we are just one small part of a much larger whole, and that our actions have far-reaching consequences. The concept of "God" or a higher power has evolved over time, from a tool for explaining the mysteries of the universe to a means of bringing people together and transcending our differences. Spiritual people throughout time have intuited that God energy is everywhere, and it permeates our own energy, and the energy of all living things and all matter in the universe. And, it's that, which separates Humanity from God because it suggests God was here, not evolving with life on Earth, but that life on Earth evolved into conscious awareness and a self awareness of itself as God. Representations of God as we conceptualise them, emerged from the evolution of consciousness.

It genuinely doesn't matter how you represent God in your culture. All ideologies and representations of God are interpretations of one energy. Imagine throwing all understandings of God into a God-soup, and using a centrifuge to then extract the constituent ingredients. There are really only two ingredients that can actually be centrifuged from that soup. One being subjective narrative designed to subjugate people (or help people organise under hierarchy), and the other being subjective wisdom based on humanity's highest aspirational intentions, designed to bring about harmony and Earth's homeostasis. In my opinion it's absolutely essential to recompose and modernise our representations of God from the most aspirational wisdom humanity has to offer, the parts that drive Earth's homeostasis. Resynthesizing everything we understand, from ancient wisdom, buried in the Earth's crust and in our DNA as well as philosophy and religious texts from all walks of life, but especially now, resynthesizing the rich and diverse heritage of native and indigenous people, to reincorporate the stone age dreamtime and shared stories, passed down through generations over millennia enabling native and indigenous people to properly care for themselves, the land and sea with highly sustainable practices and kindness, and more conventional aspirational wisdom learned through our greatest feats of scientific and technological achievement in today's technological exponentiality. This resynthesis is key to global harmony and reestablishing the foundations for aspirational humanity. It doesn't mean we all need to believe the same thing, it means we acknowledge the abstract truth and equality of all stories and cultural backgrounds to share in their wisdom, and enjoy them equally in the spirit of their wisdom, energising belief in our capacity to act as one, in all of our diversity and individuality but to be together and an unconditionally kind custodian for many generations to come.

It doesn't matter if you see Humanity as God or God as responsible for Humanity, what matters is that as life on earth, the universe is ours, and we are able to tap into the energy of gratitude giving us the wisdom to show unconditional kindness to all people and to recognise their innate equality and human rights. 

## Free Palestine

The notion of a single group having exclusive claim to a piece of land based on religious beliefs (subjective narrative) is highly problematic, as it ignores the complex history and realities of the region. Palestine has been home to many different peoples and cultures over the centuries, and it's important to acknowledge and respect the rights and perspectives of all of these groups.

Freeing Palestine is much deeper than simply freeing Palestine. When Palestine is free the west will fall from its self-assigned "humanitarian saviour complex". I think fear of being exposed as fraudulent "humanitarian saviours" is the reality of why the west are supporting the Israeli's destruction of Palestine currently. It's like a last-ditch, narcissistic effort to sweep their bad deeds under the rug and destroy the evidence. Palestine is the razors edge in 2024. All indigenous people are free when Palestine is free. Palestine is a symbol of the broader struggle for native peoples rights and self-determination around the world. The west has often positioned itself as a beacon of human rights and justice, but this position is undercut by its support for the ongoing occupation and oppression of Palestine. It's as if the west is trying to destroy the evidence of its own hypocrisy and wrongdoing, rather than facing up to the consequences of its actions because it knows liberation of Palestine will be a powerful symbolic victory for indigenous peoples everywhere. It would send a message that even the most powerful nations and systems of oppression can be challenged and overcome, and that the rights of indigenous peoples must be respected and protected.

## Genocidal Sorry Business

I'm not in favour of an east or west and I don't believe in fighting racism with racism of any kind. I see the Westminster system of democracy as inherently corruptible and I think we should be diverging away from this towards a democratic model (a direct democracy) that empowers First Nations people along their traditional borders, not those established by colonial nation states of today. I think we should embody oneness and togetherness, we should nurture diversity through establishing a single regime of kindness, empowered by radical truth and aspirational humanity that truly embraces traditional culture and wisdom while establishing a global accountability for our shared success. I am in favour of one world that is respectful of indigenous peoples, cultural diversity, humanity and planetary sustainability. This requires all individuals to bring humility upon themselves (bitch be humble) and to participate in authentic sorry business for what has been lost, what has been stolen, and the trail of despair and destruction colonial actions have caused. It's not enough to say I didn't do it, so it's not relevant to me. It's always relevant because the ramifications are all around us, in our blood, and the basis of our shared future and without understanding of the suffering of others, there will be no compassion or togetherness. 

Without proper sorry business we fail to recognise the suffering of others, and we risk repeating the same mistakes again and again. I hope all colonizing groups can relinquish hateful dominance over indigenous peoples and return land and governance to the people who for a long time before colonisation, were accountable to their lands, living sustainably and respectfully within the environment. It's their act of doing so which protected and made sustainable the same land colonisers extract from; they essentially externalised the cost of maintenance and hard work onto the native people while committing hateful acts of genocide against them. The atrocities are still relevant, and we need to accept the truth about ourselves to understand that.

Transcending the artificial borders of our nations, cultures and religious divides in favour of our shared humanity and planetary sustainability means challenging existing power structures and ideologies that are based on competition and domination, and working towards a more cooperative and equitable society together. We must approach this work with humility and a willingness to listen to others. By acknowledging our own limitations and blind spots, being honest about our shortcomings, we can learn from each other and build a more diverse and resilient movement for change that recognises we are all part of a complex, interdependent web of life worthy of future success.

A global realization of humility and unconditional kindness could go a long way in moving towards a more just and sustainable world. These values are at the heart of many of the positive changes that we need to make as a society, from addressing climate change to ending poverty and inequality. So while humility and kindness are essential values, we must also be willing to take concrete actions and take our sorry business seriously to bring about the systemic and cultural changes that are necessary to truly realize these values in the world.
It requires the breaking of false lines such as political and religious borders and even national borders. What is required is a deeper understanding of who we are. Our religious ideologies, nationality and cultural identities can be nurtured and respected for their representative kindness and the wisdom they impart that leads to our sustainability, but they should never divide us or force us to homogenize or erase another culture.

## Exhaustion & Renewal

Challenging deeply ingrained beliefs and narratives can be difficult, especially when they are tied to religious or cultural identities. But it's important to remember that these beliefs and narratives are ultimately human creations, and that we have the power to shape them in ways that are more aligned with our shared values of justice and compassion. Our planetary homeostasis and the sustainability of life on Earth should be our ultimate concern. By working together towards this shared goal, we can transcend the limitations of borders and move towards a more just, equitable, and peaceful world.

This is my Palestine. I hope to find and align with people who share these considerations and values.
