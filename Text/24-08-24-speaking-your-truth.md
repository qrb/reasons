# Speaking your Truth

### People in your life will set out to intentionally misunderstand you even after being given clear communication about your needs and affordances.

My name is Lee Tagg, and I'm a kind and empathetic person with AuDHD who cares deeply about truth and justice, particularly for innocent and vulnerable people and for those who are being lied to. I support the underdogs of this world and hope to live out the rest of my life doing exactly that.

I have extremely high justice sensitivity, but it took over 40 years for the reality and beauty of my life to authentically emerge and I have to accept that a lot of my behavior in childhood, as a teenager and even as an adult did not stem from a healthy and truthful place and the most important part of learning to love myself and value who I am was the result of establishing healthy boundaries.

I am autistic and affected by ADHD. Some people call this combination AuDHD and I like that term because it's a single point of reference for what I experience as a whole condition.

The AuDHD combination is quite important to recognise as a disability. I apologise to those who seek empowerment through perceiving it as a super-ability, but you have to accept that at times, it's not always super. It's not a disability you will pick up on in the first five minutes of meeting me, I didn't know for 42 years. Others did, but they labelled me as weird or insane and chose to shame me instead of supporting my needs in this condition.

When you experience my nervous system dysregulation without understanding it, you may be mistaken for thinking I'm pretending or trying to undermine my own purpose. I will probably notice my dysregulation after you, not before, but I will now understand it for what it is and you might not.

A particularly pertinent example of this is my numeracy and mathematical ability. It doesn't affect my intelligence or capacity for accurate work when I'm regulated, but it does cause skill regression when I force myself into situations that lead to nervous system dysregulation and burnout. My aptitude for numbers is almost perfectly in-sync with the hustle and speed of the working environment. This is to a point where I can't perform basic operations on sequences of single digit numbers. If you understand this about me, you will realise I am not suited to the high intensity role of operating a checkout because in that situation I can't add two and two when the pressure builds up. At the same time, In a slow paced setting where speed is not a requirement, I am confident in game physics, system analysis, programming and designing spreadsheets and financial systems. A big part of managing this disability is in developing boundaries and methods of coping with other peoples expectations, preconceptions of what I should and shouldn't be capable of and subsequently, their projections due to a lack of understanding.

Many people in my life have set out to intentionally misunderstand me even after being given clear communication about my needs and the affordances that would be required for healthy redirection of our relationship and to avoid burnout and the traps of both Autism and ADHD.

I've spent most of my life self-invalidating as a people pleaser and unfortunately the people I've pleased in the past are lost when it comes to the truth because they feel somehow like a victim to a malevolent paradox of evil genius and utter stupidity. They refuse to acknowledge and incorporate the very real affect of AuDHD in my life and theirs. In the past this has enabled unhealthy relational dynamics to emerge and when I notice that continuing nowadays I HAVE TO sever the relationship in order for it to regrow healthy and abundantly. If you are someone I've cut off in the past, just know that it's because I value you enough to develop a healthy relationship and it's not a static judgement call.

I am not perfect and while I always aim to tell the truth, I can make mistakes. At times, I am unable to live up to my own expectations and I may even fall short of yours. But I do acknowledge my capacity for error and I try to have the humility to accept when my mistakes stand between present reality and my goals. This is a crucial aspect of how I develop and improve myself. If you thought the truth was a common-sense aspect of intelligence you probably also find yourself frequently stumped and disappointed. Having a lifetime of experience with codependent narcissistic dynamics, I have learnt that truthful communication is far less normal than expected, and the majority of people in those situation will remain loyal to a false narrative, even as the scapegoat, rather than be exposed for making mistakes.

In the environment where I grew up, kids were expected to speak the truth, but it was always spoken into a vacuum that got emptied under a rug of codependency. The adults' shame for their neglect was transferred onto the children to carry throughout their lives and no accountability was ever instilled. To this day, those that have been scapegoated and made the black sheep still unwittingly harbour the shame of the people who intentionally hurt them, while other members of the family fiercely protect ingenuine facades and continue to disproportionately apportion blame and shame onto their selected scapegoats because this has worked for them in the past.

When people who can accept their flaws and mistakes, without embarrassment, form into groups that normalise truth-telling, the result is authentic achievement. Where we lack the integrity to accept our own mistakes no truth can exist. This means we must constantly fight to maintain a false narrative and the groups we belong to are undermined by our lack of honesty and may even conform to it. Either way, the group can no longer achieve authentic success and will most likely be unable to accept responsibility for mistakes and will always blame scapegoats for their failure to responsibly achieve their goals.

Truth telling is the opposite of always being right. It's about having the flexibility to correct course and be wrong as often as you are. Embarrassment is a hallmark of any codependent narcissistic person or group because they believe making mistakes will damage their reputation even though mistakes are a natural part of 'doing your best' and successfully living life. A narcissistic group will be unable to rationalise their own capacity for error and this will become obvious as a heightened lack of personal accountability for shortcomings or setbacks and individuals in the group will express embarrassment for issues they've attributed to the scapegoat in the situation.

Whether it's a work relationship, a family member or some other association, dealing with individuals that don't recognise honesty as the foundation of integrity will be problematic. A dishonest colleague or family member will assume you are just as dishonest as they are which will cancel-out the integrity you've brought to the table. When this occurs the group becomes dysfunctional and the shame/blame feedback loop will begin and lead to manipulation, cover-ups and falsification of facts to protect the individual from embarrassment and/or damaged reputation.

In any group setting, speaking the truth is a genuine affirmation of each others potential and capacity to succeed. By communicating honestly even when others wish you wouldn't, you are honouring the whole group and acknowledging your ability to reach the highest good possible.

You are now able to overcome hurdles without embarrassment and loss of face even if you are wrong about something (because of course you are sometimes), commiting to each other's success at no extra cost and teaching them about the inherent fortitude and abundance embedded in genuine honesty which also proves the shaming and scapegoating of people is absolutely vile, perverse and obsolete to humanity.

Normalising truth-telling has many beneficial implications across individual relationships, family dynamics, work relationships, cultural dynamics, international peace-keeping to global unity. Normalised truth-telling, is so unconventional though, that we have to call it 'radical' which is an existential-paradox and an insight into what is wrong with civilisation. Codependent dynamics often function on the basis that they are 100% correct all the time. Every fact can and will be manipulated, exaggerated or twisted to fit this requirement and is done so in order to maintain reputation and perceived rightness. It's impossible to claim humane action in any aspect of your life if you also acknowledge that the truth is optional or open to interpretation.

What will follow in this sub-stack are my reasons for existing, for loving myself and for believing in humanity; offset by the experiences I've had that led to the crystallization of love in my heart and what I feel beautifully overcomes the tragedy of lies.
