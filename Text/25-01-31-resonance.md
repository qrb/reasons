# Resonance of ideas in product design

In the product development lifecycle, the Ideation phase is a process of reducing a superset (a chaotic problem space) of discordant ideas into a resonant subset of non-competing ideas that can be further harmonized and transcribed into a tangible product or multiple products derived on the same resonant set.

A quality product is the harmony produced by a resonant set of ideas.

The resonant set is an abstraction that can be used to cultivate many varying products without modifying the basis (ideas), like an abstract base or any notion of composition in OOP. It can be further extended by a combination of harmonious supersets , also composition, leading to infinite tangible product transcriptions based on a harmonious collection of resonant idea sets.

None of the ideas in the original superset (the chaos or problem space,) are invalidated when a resonant subset of ideas are ideated. They just don't resonate in harmony with the resultant subset so they aren’t going to produce a quality product. But, they still have potential for other, more nuanced resonant sets.

Each cycle of ideation may refine a subset until it is depended on by a product and at that point the set’s resonance and potential harmonies crystallize into an order (at least until the product is no longer in use). This concept is analogous to order from chaos. Once all the tangible products are obsolete and disused, the resonant subset has nothing to maintain its order and it returns to the chaos of the superset once again.

This cycle produces different results based on standards, norms and technological advancement over time.

This popped into my mind. It may or may not resonate with product designers, but I think it’s a very useful way to decouple the creative mind from its emotional attachment to a specific product design. You can attach yourself to the resonance of ideas and those resonances are always substantial regardless of the products that inherit them.
