Imagine a squatter comes along and violently strips you of your home, resources and land, forcing you to act in their servitude. You are treated like vermin for centuries, your life is enslaved, your cultural heritage is trashed, burnt up and discarded. You are forced to fight for your children's rights, perpetually, just to reach the bare minimum. You must struggle for equality, for equal say within a system that normalises your oppression and seeks to control the narrative of your life, past and present.

This squatter appropriates everything you have but also makes you submit fully to their culture. They feed you nothing but the leftover crumbs from loaves baked in your own oven with your own produce. The same oven that was violently taken from you. The oven the squatter never learned to use properly, causing permanent damage to your place, ruining future prospects for all those to come.

I am the squatters' son, a product of your suffering. I grew up in your house, in a colonial squat with my intolerant parents who's own intolerant parents displaced you from your home. Living abundantly on your land at your expense, with no knowledge of who you are, your spirituality or your cultural wealth. Trashing your name and heritage, with a system of violence that protected us from you and your rightful sovereignty and always kept you from seeking your justice.

Educated in my own superiority. I was taught by my public school to reject the true meaning of indigenous struggle as "the way it was" and "the days of old" and "we've fixed that now", but your oppression never lifted, and the colonial system that refuses to release its choke hold from your necks is still in control. A hateful and the obscene political class scuffle for power, pretending to hold valid authority, labelling you, calling you the problem. But, you are the sovereign custodians of these lands and these squatters who call themselves a government don't belong there, certainly not above your authority or rule which always was and always will be yours.

Colonial systems of government lack the extensibility required to address the needs of first-nations people let alone the flexibility to address the harm caused by colonisation to their territories. If those in colonial power saw the absurdity in this situation, and I think many politicians are not self-aware or insightful enough to do so, but even if they were; Can they apply a system of government that produces a narrow colonial mindset deeply amplified into a left and right divide, to adequately respond to the needs of the systemically abused and displaced indigenous peoples who have every right to rule over and orchestrate the system of governance they exist under?

The Venn diagram of issues our government can address doesn't even overlap a charter of needs first-nations people might seek to accommodate. This makes the Westminster system and other colonial systems of government unworkable as a future-proof model for societies seeking to prioritise first-nations sovereignty. Yes, We all have a different viewpoint and this is why continuous reintegration of cultural diversity within our systems is a must, but first nations peoples have never genuinely been given that right. Even when we cannot share consensus with others, we need an appropriate model of government that accommodates its own peoples diversity and sovereignty. I believe this means a new model of government should be developed from the ground up, led and instigated by the First Nations peoples and supporting parties, to directly address current inadequacies and to fully rectify the legacy of harm caused by the current system, and it's progenitors.

What that system looks like is not up to me, but I am interested in pushing for it's existence. As an immigrant to Australia, I am aware that my citizenship is granted by a colonial body that isn't in agreement, an authentic allegiance to, or acting in the guidance of Australia's first nations aboriginal and indigenous peoples and this is beyond disrespectful. I seek forgiveness from the first nations communities and indigenous people and want them to know that I am their ally and friend in every respect. My highest aspiration for Australia is to see an Indigenous led government whatever form that takes as long as it heals the harm caused by the events of the last 240 years.
