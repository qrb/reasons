Over the past year the world has seen 'anti-semitic' terminology pushed heavily as a redirection away from public discourse and peaceful dissent by concerned parties amongst Israel’s western counterparts after the attack by Hamas on Israel and the Israeli invasion of Gaza in October, 2023.

The term anti-semitism describes faith based bigotry or hatred aimed specifically at Jewish people. In the context of religious bigotry, using the term ‘anti-semitic’ is sensitive to a single group who have suffered deeply due to religious hatred and violence.

When western media and political leaders use the term as a sound-bite to stifle genuine humanitarian conversation it fundamentally shifts the meaning of the term in an irreversible way. Because of this, the term itself has become a symbol of religious bigotry. Western leaders using the term as a political device have watered down the fundamental value of the term ‘anti-semitism’ and it now holds less power to curb discrimination against Jewish peoples and has been conflated by the west as a means to justify oppression and apartheid of other non-Jewish groups.

All language is memetic. The meaning of any wording or terminology shifts through cultural evolution and becomes socially normalized overriding or replacing past representations. It is important to acknowledge shifts in terms such as ‘anti-semitism’ and address the divisiveness of its modern representation and to establish alternative terminology that more authentically meets the original purpose of communication when seeking to counter religious hatred and hate crime while articulately maintaining integrity of humanitarian purpose.

Humanitarian concern is not anti-semitic, but western media has made it a form of pseudo-terrorism due to this crafty memetic convergence on anti-semitism. It would benefit all religious groups facing segregation and discrimination to instead use the more general term 'anti-religious bigotry' as it is not to be politically appropriated by a single aggressor. ‘Anti-religious bigotry’ establishes an equal grounding for all religions, acknowledging equality, shared equity in a harmonious world and using this term curbs cause for further discrimination and religious hatred for the Jewish, Islamic or any other religious group.

Notes

1. Political leaders using the term ‘anti-semitism’ when faced with dissent or humanitarian opposition to state-backed action should be seen as engaging in hate speech.
2. Religious hate speech does not discriminate. Language addressing religious hatred should equally represent all religions and all religious groups capacity to experience oppression, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, violence and hatred.
3. Following this guidance helps to put an end to coercive control, willful ignorance, misinformation, racial hatred, dishonest politics and systemic abuses of power.
